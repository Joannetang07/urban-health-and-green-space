# Urban Green Spaces and Health: A Geospatial Analysis of Parks, Socioeconomic Factors, and Influenza-like Illness in NYC

*Abstract: In this urban data analysis study, I explore the relationship between the availability of parks and recreational areas, the accessibility of seasonal flu vaccination centers, and public health in New York City. The study aims to understand how these factors interact across different income levels and neighborhoods, particularly focusing on their impact on influenza-like illnesses. I hypothesize that increased accessibility to green spaces and vaccination centers correlates with improved health outcomes.*

## Introduction
Urban green spaces are increasingly recognized for their health benefits, particularly in densely populated cities like New York City. This study examines the correlation between the availability and accessibility of parks and seasonal flu vaccination centers, and their combined effect on public health. This research aim to provide a comprehensive overview of how these factors vary across different socioeconomic backgrounds and their impact on the prevalence of influenza-like illnesses.

To investigate the interplay of these relationships, three hypotheses were formulated as follows:
### Hypothesis 1A:
Neighborhoods with greater access to parks and recreational areas will exhibit lower rates of emergency department visits and admissions for influenza-like illnesses and pneumonia.

### Hypothesis 1B:
There is a disparity in the accessibility of seasonal flu vaccination centers, with lower-income neighborhoods having fewer vaccination centers per capita.

### Hypothesis 1C:
The combined availability of parks and flu vaccination centers in a neighborhood correlates positively with better public health outcomes, particularly in terms of reduced incidence of influenza-like illnesses.

## Methodology
The study employs a geospatial analysis of the distribution of parks and flu vaccination centers across New York City. I correlate this data with socioeconomic factors such as income levels and demographic information of the neighborhoods. Public health data, specifically on influenza-like illnesses, is analyzed to understand the impact of these variables.

## Findings
Hypothesis 1A (Parks and Health Outcomes): The study found insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that neighborhoods with greater access to parks and recreational areas exhibit lower rates of emergency department visits and admissions for influenza-like illnesses and pneumonia. This suggests that the mere presence of parks may not be a significant factor in reducing such health issues in these areas.

Hypothesis 1B (Vaccination Centers and Socioeconomic Status): The analysis revealed significant disparities in the number of vaccination centers per capita across different areas. There is a strong and statistically significant relationship between the number of vaccination centers and the federal amount of gross income per capita. Wealthier areas, indicated by higher federal gross income per capita, tend to have more vaccination centers. This finding highlights a socioeconomic disparity in access to healthcare resources.

Hypothesis 1C (Combined Availability of Parks and Vaccination Centers): The study did not find strong evidence to support the hypothesis that the combined availability of parks and flu vaccination centers correlates positively with better public health outcomes, specifically in terms of reduced incidence of influenza-like illnesses. The lack of statistical significance in the model and its predictors indicates that the combined availability of these facilities does not have a significant impact on reducing emergency department visits for such illnesses.

## Conclusion
The findings of this study paint a complex picture of the relationship between urban infrastructure and public health. While the availability of parks does not significantly correlate with lower rates of certain health issues, there is a clear socioeconomic divide in the distribution of flu vaccination centers. Wealthier neighborhoods benefit from greater access to these centers, indicating a disparity in healthcare resource allocation. The combined effect of park and vaccination center availability on public health outcomes, such as the incidence of influenza-like illnesses, was not found to be significant. These results highlight the need for a more nuanced approach to urban planning and healthcare resource distribution, one that takes into account the diverse needs of different communities within a city like New York. Future policies should aim to address these disparities to ensure equitable access to health-promoting resources for all residents.
